# Horse Racing Game
This was my 3rd assignment project of Web Programming class I took in college. The main idea here was have some basic practice using HTML, CSS and Javascript but we had to use functions as first class objects and also experiment with timers and timeouts. My idea was to make something similar to one of those horse race game there were many ago (see image below). The hardest part for me at the time was to make the horse oscilate as it moved forward.
