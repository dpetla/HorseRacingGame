# Horse Racing Game

An Horse Racing Game (similar to one of those available many ago, see image below) entirely made with HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript.
The main idea here was have some basic practice using HTML, CSS and Javascript but we had to use functions as first class objects and also experiment with timers and timeouts.
